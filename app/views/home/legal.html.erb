    Copyright is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. Look at these words. Are they small words?

    When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. I think the only difference between me and the other legl boilerplate text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. It’s about making legl boilerplate text great again. That’s what people want, they want legl boilerplate text to be great again.

    I think the only card she has is the legl boilerplate card. I was going to say something extremely rough to the legl boilerplate, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." I think the only card she has is the legl boilerplate card. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!

    I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote the legl boilerplate, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. the legl boilerplate is FAKE TEXT!

    The concept of ChiTunes was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. If ChiTunes weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. I was going to say something extremely rough to ChiTunes, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."
