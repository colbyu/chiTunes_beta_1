    We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly help page is one of them. I write the best help page text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.

    I write the best help page text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? I will write some great help page text – and nobody writes better help page text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Some people have an ability to write help page text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.

    I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.

    You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.

    You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting help page your entire adult life. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly help page is one of them. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!

    help page better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!

    Some people have an ability to write help page text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. Despite the constant negative help page covfefe. help page is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.

    My help page text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. I was going to say something extremely rough to help page, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."

    My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that help page's birth certificate is a fraud. I was going to say something extremely rough to help page, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."

    Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your help page text.
