    <h1>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.</h1>
    <p>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Get me a vodka rocks. And a
      piece of toast. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best
      defense.</p>
    <p>There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray.

      diet is the best defense. Well, what do you expect, mother? There's so many poorly chosen words in that
      sentence.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid I just blue myself. Army had half a day. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and
      answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. Oh, you're gonna be in a

      <li>Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</li>

    <p>It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast
      enough. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried
      about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>
    <p>Steve Holt! Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. First place chick is hot, but has
      an attitude, doesn't date magicians. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.</p>

    <p>It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. That's why you always leave a note! Across from
      where? First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. But I bought a yearbook ad from you,
      doesn't that mean anything anymore?</p>
    <p>No… but I'd like to be asked! Michael! Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Steve Holt! Steve
      Holt! No… but I'd like to be asked!</p>
    <p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Really? Did nothing cancel? I hear the jury's
      still out on science. That's why you always leave a note!</p>
    <p>I'm afraid I just blue myself. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I'm afraid I just blue myself. No! I was
      ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Army had half a day. Say goodbye to these, because it's the
      last time!</p>
    <p>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of
      toast. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is
      a television actor.</p>
